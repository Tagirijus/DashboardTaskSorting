# Description

This is a small plugin for [Kanboard](https://kanboard.org/), a free and open source Kanban project management system. It changes the sorting of the _tasks_ on the _dashboard_ overview and tasks site.

# How to install

Create a new folder inside your Kanboard installation under _plugins_ like: `plugins/TagiDashboardTaskSorting` and move the content of this repo directly there.

# Why

I like the tasks to be sorted by default by _due date_ so that most important tasks will show up on the top by default.

# Todo

- let tasks without a due date appear on bottom in the projects tasks list as well
- maybe add some configuration stuff later?
